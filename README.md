# Tweet_emotion_analysed
This project analyses the sentiment level of any tweet and plots the total percentage of tweets which were liked and hated,along with various levels between them. 

NOTE:- THIS IS A SIMPLE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE TEXTBLOB LIBRARY, WITH NO HARCORE NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TECHNIQUES BEING APPLIED, DATA CAN BE DIVIDED INTO TEST AND TRAINING DATA BUT WITH SUCH A LESS AMOUNT OF DATA THAT BECOMES HIGHLY IRRRELEVANT TO DO SO.
